# 吐槽

- 爱GitHub真是太好啦，看个文档到处都是hyperlink呢，引导着导着一走神，哦嚯，忘了自己在哪了
- 如果能用录屏软件类似OBS，录出教程就好了呢，我感觉尽管有人这么做了，但是authority并没有给出相关的链接
- 大部分的中文教程都是针对特定发行版本的linux，我用的是win10啊，大哥，能不能让我们一切归零再来谈？
- 我知道以后工作要基于Linux系统，但是我还是想用win10学习GitHub啊，什么？，你说，你也不会，那我学会了来教你哦
- 等我哦~ ^ ^
- 现在2020年12月25日19点34分的我只想把git这个VCS工具玩成一个类似于百度网盘的东西，😂😂

简单地说 本文档covers everything you need to make the most of GitHub for development.

## Getting started with GitHub

### Set up Git

<https://git-scm.com/download/win>

Your download is starting...

You are downloading the latest (**2.29.2**) **64-bit** version of **Git for Windows**. This is the most recent [maintained build](https://git-for-windows.github.io/). It was released **17 days ago**, on 2020-12-08.

Now What?

Now that you have downloaded Git, it's time to start using it.

1. Read the Book<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>可在线读也可下载pdf阅读。

Dive into the Pro Git book and learn at your own pace.

2. Download a GUI<>

Several free and commercial GUI tools are available for the Windows platform.

3. Get Involved

A knowledgeable Git community is available to answer your questions.

#### in [Cloning with HTTPS URLs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use#cloning-with-https-urls)

> Authenticate

认证==prove

> cache your GitHub credentials in Git

在Git中缓存您的GitHub凭据

> Password-based authentication for Git is **deprecated**

==diapproval

#### in [Creating a personal access token(PAT)个人访问令牌](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

> As a security precaution

作为安全预防措施

我已经玩成了PAT的创建`就不告诉你`

#### in [cache your GitHub credentials in Git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git)

You can also install a native Git shell, such as [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/). With Git for Windows, running the following in the command line will store your credentials:

这应该就是git的gui界面吧。

#### OVER



### Creat a repo

> A *[commit](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/articles/github-glossary#commit)* is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time.

快照

> You can attribute the commit to

归功于



### Fork a repo

> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

> Submit a pull request to the project owner.

pull request 长出新树对比新branches请求

> For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project.

开源就完事了

> 原来可以直接通过
>
> > You can also take a free [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) course on maintaining open source communities.
>
> 这个学习

> Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

cd /d/acwing/github



### Be social

> dashboard

仪表盘

> Discover interesting projects using [Explore GitHub](https://github.com/explore), [Explore repositories](https://github.com/explore), and the [Trending page](https://github.com/trending). Star interesting projects and come back to them later. Visit your [stars page](https://github.com/stars) to see all your starred projects. For more information, see "[About your personal dashboard](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/articles/about-your-personal-dashboard)."

之前就看到有人说现在不常用GitHub了，只是偶尔看看trending page，来发现有趣的事情，原来如此啊


# Writing on GitHub

一上来就接触到了typora提到的GFW(GitHub Flavored Markdown)了呢。

in [gfw](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

> backticks

反引号 ````

> nested lists
>
> - dfadf
>   - dsdsf
>     - sdf
>
> haha

![touxiang](./taiharenle.jpg)

这是测试能不能在gfm中显示出来图片。

读这个就够了

# [Using Git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git)

> Learn common and advanced workflows in Git to enhance your experience using GitHub.

工作流神乎其神的描述了他的抽象形象

### Leaning about Git

#### [Git workflows→](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/git-workflows)

GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects that deploy regularly.

### [Using Visual Studio Code as your editor](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/associating-text-editors-with-git#using-visual-studio-code-as-your-editor-1)

无聊感觉。。。

### Using common Git commands

真要学git命令还是从gitpro学吧https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/

git的版本控制思想是分为三个部分管理，用户工作区，代码托管区，远程仓库区（github）。
